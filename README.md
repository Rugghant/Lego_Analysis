# LEGO Dataset Analysis  

## Overview  
This project explores the rich history of LEGO, analyzing trends in product offerings, themes, and set complexity over time. Leveraging Python for data manipulation and visualization, we dive deep into the LEGO dataset to uncover intriguing insights about one of the world's most beloved toy companies.  

## Objectives  
this analysis address the following key questions:  
- What is the largest LEGO set ever created in terms of parts?  
- When did LEGO release its first sets, and how many products were initially offered?  
- Which theme has the most LEGO sets â€” a licensed theme like Harry Potter or an original LEGO theme like Ninjago?  
- How has LEGO expanded its product offering over time?  
- Did the size and complexity of LEGO sets evolve over the years?  

## Data Source  
The dataset for this analysis is sourced from [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/), which provides detailed data on LEGO sets, themes, colors, and parts.  

### Files Used  
- `colors.csv`: Contains data on the colors used in LEGO pieces.  
- `sets.csv`: Lists LEGO sets by year and includes attributes like number of parts.  
- `themes.csv`: Details LEGO themes and their corresponding IDs.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for interactive data exploration and visualization  

## Analysis Highlights  
### 1. Unique LEGO Colors  
- **Number of Unique Colors**: 135.  
- Transparent vs. Opaque Colors: Transparent colors accounted for 21%, while opaque colors made up 79%.  

### 2. Evolution of LEGO Sets  
- **First LEGO Sets**: Released in 1949.  
- **Largest LEGO Set**: BIGBOX-1 with 9987 parts.  
- **Year-on-Year Growth**: Visualized how LEGO expanded its product catalog over decades.  

### 3. Themes with the Most Sets  
- The top LEGO theme by number of sets is STAR WARS.  

### 4. Complexity of LEGO Sets Over Time  
- Average number of parts per set has increased significantly since the early years.  

## Visualizations  
Key visualizations include:  
- Line charts illustrating the growth of LEGO sets and themes over time.  
- Scatter plots showcasing trends in LEGO set complexity.  
- Bar charts highlighting the top themes by number of sets.
